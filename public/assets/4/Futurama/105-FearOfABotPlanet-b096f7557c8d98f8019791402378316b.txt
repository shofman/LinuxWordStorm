               [Ships Cockpit. Fry and Leela are standing in front of the couch 
               looking out of the windscreen into open space.]
 
               
                                     LEELA
                         What do you think of the view, Fry?
 
                         
               
                                     FRY
                         It really puts things in perspective. 
                         I mean, from up here an entire world 
                         can seem utterly insignificant.
 
               
               [A small planet splats onto the windscreen like a fly onto a 
               car. Leela presses a button and the windscreen wiper cleans it 
               off.]

               [Madison Cube Garden Pitch. The crew are sat watching what could 
               be a baseball game between the New New York Yankees and the Mars 
               Greenskins...]
 
               
                                     BENDER
                         Hey, nice seats! We're close enough 
                         to when you knock a player down with 
                         a beer bottle, he stays down.
 
               
                                     FRY
                         I don't get this. Is blernsball exactly 
                         the same as baseball?
 
               
                                     FARNSWORTH
                         Baseball? God forbid!

               
                                     LEELA
                         Face it, Fry. Baseball was as boring 
                         as mom and apple pie. That's why they 
                         jazzed it up.
 
               
                                     FRY
                         Boring? Baseball wasn't -- hmm, so they 
                         finally jazzed it up?
 
               
               [A player hits the ball. Fry jumps up, cheering.]

               
                                     FRY
                         Home run! Ha ha! Yay! Right?

               
               [The ball is attached to a piece of elastic and springs back. 
               A player catches it and the momentum carries him so he flies 
               through the air with the ball. He reaches out and hits a base.]
 
               
               
                                     UMPIRE
                         Out!

               
               [The crowd cheers and Leela writes on her scorecard.]

               
                                     FRY
                         What just happened? Why is the ball 
                         on that springy thing?
 
               
                                     LEELA
                         It's traditional. Just like aluminium 
                         bats and the seventh inning grope.
 
                         
               
               [Another hit. A player jumps to catch the ball but misses it 
               and is caught by Bender.]
 
               
                                     BENDER
                         I got me a souvenir!  Aww, here you 
                         go, kid!
 
               
               [He hands the player to the boy.]

               
               [Madison Cube Garden Corridor. Zoidberg comes out of the Gents 
               and approaches a vendor.]
 
               
                                     ZOIDBERG
                         I'd like a jumbo squid log, please.
 
                         
               
                                     VENDOR
                         We don't sell those.

               
                                     ZOIDBERG
                         Alright, alright. Let me have one of 
                         your young on a roll.
 
               
                                     VENDOR
                         We're outta rolls.

               
                                     ZOIDBERG
                         Fine! Just give me something crawling 
                         with parasites.
 
               
               [Cut to: Madison Cube Garden Pitch. Back in the bleachers, Zoidberg 
               eat a hotdog and purrs. The others have hotdogs too. Fry takes 
               a bite.]
 
               
                                     FRY
                         Mmm, at least hotdogs haven't changed.
 
                         
               
                                     BENDER
                         Hey, buddies, who wants popcorn?

               
               Leela Oh, I'll have some.

               
                                     FRY
                         Me!

               
                                     FARNSWORTH
                         Oh, yes!

               
                                     ZOIDBERG
                         Yes, please, popcorn!

               
               [Popping noises come from Bender's chest cabinet. He opens it 
               and takes out a large tub of popcorn.]

                         Anyone want butter on that?

               
               [He pumps his antenna.]

                         Hey, I'm starting to get the hang of 
                         this game. The blerns are loaded, the 
                         count's three blerns and two anti-blerns 
                         and the infield blern rule is in effect, 
                         right?
 
               
                                     LEELA
                         Except for the word "blern" that was 
                         complete gibberish.
 
               
               [Something beeps. The blernsball falls into a hole and some things 
               come up in the pitch. The crowd cheers.]

               bases exploding behind him. A bullpen opens and someone comes 
               out riding a huge spider. Fry scratches his head in confusion.

                                     LEELA
                         Alright! Yes! Miller's on a pace to 
                         hit 70 blerns!
 
               
                                     FARNSWORTH
                         He's good, alright. But he's no Clem 
                         Johnson. And Johnson played back in 
                         the days before steroid injections were 
                         mandatory.
 
               
                                     BENDER
                         Clem Johnson? That skin bag wouldn't 
                         have lasted one pitch in the old Robot 
                         Leagues! Now Wireless Joe Jackson, there 
                         was a blern hitting machine!
 
               
                                     LEELA
                         Exactly! He was a machine designed to 
                         hit blerns! I mean, come on, Wireless 
                         Joe was nothing but a programmable bat 
                         on wheels.

                         Oh, and I suppose Pitchomat 5000 was 
                         just a modified howitzer?
 
               
                                     LEELA
                         Yep.

                         You humans are so scared of a little 
                         robot competition you won't even let 
                         us on the field.
 
               
                                     FRY
                         What are you talking about? There's 
                         all kinds of robots down there.
 
               
                                     BENDER
                         Yeah, doing crap work! They're bat boys, 
                         ball polishers, sprinkler systems. But 
                         how many robot managers are there?
 
                         
               
                                     FRY
                         11?

               
                                     BENDER
                         Zero!  And what a surprise! Look who's 
                         scraping up the filth. Is it a human 
                         child? I wish!
 
               
               [Farnsworth suddenly leans forward, clutching his chest.]

                         What's wrong?

               
                                     FARNSWORTH
                         It's...my...new pager.

               
               [He takes his pager out of his lab coat and turns it on. A holographic 
               image of Hermes appears in front of him.]

                         This is Hermes. A package just came 
                         in. Everyone is to return to the office 
                         immediately.  Get away, you filthy bird! 
                         Shoo! Shoo! Professor, turn me off, 
                         quick!
 
               
                                     FARNSWORTH

                         Admit it: You all think robots are just 
                         machines built by humans to make their 
                         lives easier.

                         and you know it!
 
               
               [Enter Farnsworth and a bandaged Hermes, who holds a box with 
               a Planet Express label on it and "Chapek 9" written on it.]
 
               
               
                                     FARNSWORTH
                         Great news, everyone. You'll be delivering 
                         a package to Chapek 9, a world where 
                         humans are killed on sight.
 
               
                                     FRY
                         Why is that great news?

               
                                     FARNSWORTH
                         I'm glad you asked that question, Fry. 
                         You see, Chapek 9 was colonised centuries 
                         ago by a murderous crew of radical robot 
                         separatists.

                         Oh, so just 'cause a robot wants to 
                         kill humans that makes him a "radical"?
 
                         
               
                                     LEELA
                         Hey, hold on. I understand these robots 
                         hate humans, but how do they feel about 
                         humanoid aliens?

                         That's why Bender will have to make 
                         the actual delivery.
 
               
                                     BENDER
                         Oh, I get it, make the robot do all 
                         the work!
 
               
                                     LEELA
                         This is the first actual work you've 
                         ever had to do around here.
 
               
                                     BENDER
                         Well I'm not doing it! It's a robot 
                         holiday.
 
               
                                     FRY
                         Really? Which one?

               
                                     BENDER
                         Only Robanukah. The holiest two weeks 
                         on the robot calendar.
 
               
                                     LEELA
                         Oh, come on, Bender. Last month it was 
                         Robomadom and before that Robonza.

                         Man, that one was a blast!

               
                                     BENDER
                         It wasn't just a blast. It was a sacred 
                         tribute to my ancestral prototypes which 
                         happened to take the form of a drinking 
                         contest.
 
               
                                     HERMES
                         Now, look here, Bender. I respect your 
                         diversity to the extent the law requires 
                         but you used up all your days off when 
                         you had that bout with Roberculosis.
 
                         
               
                                     BENDER
                         Alright, I'll go. But so help me, I'll 
                         hold a grudge against every last stinking 
                         one of you for the rest of your lives.

                         Well then it's settled. So long, everyone!

                         So let me get this straight: This planet 
                         is completely uninhabited?
 
               
                                     BENDER
                         No. It's inhabited by robots!

               
                                     FRY
                         Oh. Kinda like how a warehouse is inhabited 
                         by boxes.
 
               
               [Bender mutters to himself.]

               [Ships Cargo Bay. Leela holds a remote control to operate the 
               magnetic winch.]
 
               
                                     LEELA
                         OK, Bender, we're here. It's time to 
                         get to work.
 
               
                                     BENDER
                         Yes, Miss Leela. Tote that space barge, 
                         lift that space pale.
 
               
                                     LEELA
                         Now we can't land on the surface because 
                         those robots will kill Fry and me. So 
                         we'll have to stay up here and lower 
                         you with the winch. And remember: You 
                         don't know humans, you don't work for 
                         humans, and, above all, you don't like 
                         humans.
 
               
                                     BENDER
                         (ironic) I'll try to keep that in mind!

                         Hmm, he seems pretty angry.

               
                                     FRY
                         Yeah, but I guess I'd be kinda angry 
                         too if I had to go to some uninhabited 
                         planet.
 
               
                                     LEELA
                         Maybe we ought to do something nice 
                         for him.

                         robot we care about him.

                         an easy decision. If only I had two 
                         or three minutes to think about it.

                         got to look and act exactly like robots.

                         like robots and, if necessary, solve 
                         complex differential equations like 
                         robots.

                         have the honour of executing the prisoners.

                                     YELLOW ELDER
                         Here: Use the ceremonial killer-ma-jig.
 
                         
               
                                     BENDER
                         Uh, I'm a little tired right now. Would 
                         it be alright if I just gave 'em a savage 
                         beating?
 
               
                                     BLUE ELDER
                         No! The Elders have spoken. Show us 
                         the killing skills than have made you 
                         a media darling.
 
               
                                     GREEN ELDER
                         Do it now! Kill them before they bring 
                         down our whole society!
 
               
                                     ELDERS
                         (chanting) Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! 
                         Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do 
                         it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it!
 
               
                                     BENDER
                         Aww!  I can't kill them. Plenty of humans 
                         have mistreated robots but not these 
                         two. They're my friends. Humans are 
                         no threat to us. They're stupid, putrid 
                         cowards.
 
               
                                     FRY

                                     BENDER
                         The fact is, humans are completely harmless.

                                     BLUE ELDER
                         Of course. But they're useful to us 
                         as a scapegoat to distract the public 
                         from their real problem.

                         Robot Elders.

                                     BLUE ELDER
                         Quiet, Jimmy.

               
                                     BENDER
                         Well, I'm glad we got all that out in 
                         the open. We'll just let ourselves out.

                                     BLUE ELDER

                         kill!
 
               
               [They form a line and sharp things come out of their arms. They 
               move towards Fry, Leela and Bender who back away. Fry suddenly 
               leaps forward.]
 
               
                                     FRY
                         Stop! Take one more step and I'll breathe 
                         fire on you!
 
               
               [The Elders exchange glances.]

                                     YELLOW ELDER
                         Can they really breathe fire or did 
                         we make that up?
 
               
                                     BLUE ELDER
                         Gee, I can't remember anymore! It might 
                         just be from that stupid movie.
 
               
                                     ORANGE ELDER

               [Chapek 9 Surface. Outside the robot complex, Fry, Leela and 
               Bender run towards the winch with hundreds of robots chasing 
               them. They jump onto it and Leela presses the button.]

                         the package.

                         Wow, I can't believe you guys did all 
                         this for me! This is the best Robanukah 
                         ever!

                         do respect your robot heritage.

                         Robanukah up to get out of work, right?

                         do you do that?
