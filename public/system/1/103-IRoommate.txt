               [Planet Express: Meeting Room. Fry is asleep on the big table. 
               The other staff are sat around it for a morning meeting. His 
               alarm clock goes off and he reaches over and pushes Bender's 
               antenna down.]
 
               
                                     BENDER
                         Hey!

               
               [He picks up the alarm clock and bends it on the table so it 
               looks like a melted clock from Salvador Dali's artwork The Persistence 
               Of Memory.]

                         Fry, mon, if you're going to be living 
                         in the office you could at least be 
                         on time for work.
 
               
                                     FRY
                         I'm sorry. I was up really late poking 
                         through people's desks.
 
               
               [He gets up and climbs off the table.]

                         Alright, people. I will now outline 
                         today's 12-point agenda. We'll begin 
                         with point one then race forward --

               bowl of Bachelor Chow. He turns the tap on and covers it in water.]
 
               
               
               [Cut to: Planet Express: Meeting Room. Fry sits down, still in 
               his underwear.]

                         Concerning our pest problem: Somebody's 
                         been leaving food around and it's attracting 
                         owls. And I, for one, am getting tired 
                         of cleaning those owl traps.  Now......as 
                         this shocking graph indicates, our water 
                         consumption has tripled in the last 
                         month. I notice Fry has been here for 
                         a month, so I'm appointing him head 
                         of a committee to find who's responsible. 
                         Fry?  Am I cracking up, or is Fry's 
                         living here starting to get in the way 
                         of bus -
 
               
               [He is interrupted again by Fry, who is drying his hair using 
               the ships engine. Leela runs over and hits the emergency shutdown 
               button.]

                         getting a huge dose of radiation!

                         Do you know how long it's going to take 
                         me to recalibrate these engines?

                         Hey, when you look this good, you don't 
                         have to know anything.
 
               
               [Planet Express: Farnsworth's Lab. Farnsworth is looking for 
               something. Enter Leela, Bender, Hermes, Amy and Zoidberg.]

                         Professor, We need to talk to you about 
                         Fry.

                         That's right, we want some money -- 
                         wait, what's this about Fry?
 
               
                                     LEELA
                         He's a nice guy but we think it's about 
                         time he got his own place.
 
               
                                     FARNSWORTH
                         Oh, fuff! He's not causing any trouble. 
                         Now, if you don't mind, I'm rather busy. 
                         I seem to have mislaid my alien mummy. 
                          This sarcophagus should contain the 
                         remains of Emperor Nimballa, who ruled 
                         Zubin 5 over 29 million years ago.
 
                         
               
               [Fry walks past the lab eating the mummy.]

                         My God, this is an outrage! I was going 
                         to eat that mummy! Fry has got to go!

                         have anything good on.

                         time, Monique, and well, will you marry 
                         me?

                         this office...
 
               
                                     FRY

                         Right.

                         hole?

                                     BENDER
                         That's a human.

               
                                     FRY
                         What's he do?

               
                                     BENDER
                         Eh, the usual human stuff. He laughs, 
                         he learns, he loves.
 
               
                                     FRY
                         Boring!

                          Calculon? I thought you were in a coma.

                          That's what I wanted you to think with 
                         your soft, human brain.

                         It looked good but I just don't feel 
                         like eating. You want it?

                         I can't believe they threw me out like 
                         that. I must have been really acting 
                         like a jerk.

                         this jerk.  That's my philosophy. So, 
                         where you gonna stay?

               junk off a shelf into a bag then replaces a Slurm poster with 
               a poster of a woman in a bikini and Bender hangs up a poster 
               of a topless robot next to it. Fry and Bender both smoke a cigar. 
               Fry puts an old chair in a bag, Bender stamps it down and Fry 
               uses it as a beanbag. Bender puts a signed (and obviously stolen) 
               photo of Calculon on a shelf. Bender and Fry look around, satisfied.]

                         Or we could live underground with the 
                         mutants. A little fire'll show 'em who's

                         we could do this with you going and 
                         me not going?

                         anyway. Won't you be just as happy back 
                         in your old place?

                         visit me here.

                         it! Don't try and stop me! Here goes.

                         Hey, it works! The static's gone.

                          I hate that this came between us, Calculon.

                          Me too. I'm filled with a large number 
                         of powerful emotions.

                          You're my best friend. I'm sorry I 
                         treated you so badly.

                         Nothing. I guess I'm just going to have 
                         to get used to being half a robot.

                         Aww, this isn't right. Listen, Bender, 
                         if we found your antenna could they 
                         still reattach it?
 
               
                                     BENDER
                         Maybe. If we get it on ice right away.

                         This time, you'll have all the human 
                         comfort. We'll get a couple of toilets, 
                         some food cookers, maybe a puppy.

                         It sure is. By the way, I saved your

                         live in here?
