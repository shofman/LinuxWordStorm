Discussion:

What to do to start: look at a simple experiment which shows some of the underlying properties. Maybe find a few more examples which could easily be implemented.

General problem with a lot of the reading: As soon as you get into a matter really deep, it may become harder to see similarities in other fields which were 'obvious' when comparing the two (or more) fields from a more distant perspective. On a similar note, these similarities could arise due to overgerneralization. Even if they are not, they may not even be important, but just side effects.

Examples of the wanted type of MAS: Crowd animation, ants pushing an object, prosthetics, swarm behaviour, robot control, robot interaction.
