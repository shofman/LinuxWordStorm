               [Planet Express: Meeting Room. Fry, Bender and Leela sit around 
               a big green table facing a big screen which Farnsworth stands 
               in front of.]

                         As new employees I'd like your opinion 
                         on our commercial. I paid to have it 
                         air during the Superbowl.
 
               
                                     FRY

                         Not on the same channel, of course.
 
                         
               
               [He puts a tiny video into the VCR and the commercial appears 
               on the screen. A man is sat in his office and a huge green horrible 
               gelatinous blob with three eyes is in front of him.]

                          Interplanetary deliveries - what a 
                         headache!

                          When those other companies aren't brave 
                         or foolhardy enough to go, trust Planet 
                         Express for reliable, on time delivery.
 
                         
               
               [As the announcer speaks the Planet Express ship streaks across 
               the screen being chased by spaceships shooting lasers at it. 
               A man runs across an ice world with a parcel while at the same 
               time being bombed. He delivers the parcel and is snatched by 
               a gigantic vulture. Back in the office Evans lifts up a parcel.]

                          Here's your package, Mr. Horrible Gelatinous 
                         Blob.
 
               
               
               [He eats Evans anyway.]

                          Thank you, sir!

               
               [The Planet Express logo - a simplified picture of the ship flying 
               across a white circle with "Planet Express" written around it 
               - appears on the screen.]

               [The bird is still carrying the man and squawks. The commercial 
               ends.]

                         Are there really giant birds like that?
 
                         
               
                                     FARNSWORTH
                         No, no! That was all just special effects! 
                         Now let's have breakfast. I hope everyone 
                         likes eggs.
 
               
               [Cut to: Planet Express: Kitchen. Farnsworth opens a box of eggs. 
               They are giant bird eggs. One hatches and the bird inside tries 
               to eat him. He hits it with a frying pan.]

               street. He is wearing a green suit and glasses. He unlocks the 
               door and turns the open sign around from "Sorry, We're Closed" 
               to "Sorry, We're Open".]
 
               
               [Cut to: Planet Express. Meeting Room. Fry, Bender, Farnsworth 
               and Leela are sat around the table. Fry pours some cereal into 
               a bowl, Bender relaxes and Leela looks at a clipboard.]

                         I'm never going to get used to the 31st 
                         century.  Caffinated bacon? Baconated 
                         grapefruit? Admiral Crunch?
 
               
                                     LEELA
                         Well, if you don't like that try some 
                         Archduke Chocula.
 
               
               [She holds up a box of the cereal. Enter the Jamaican man with

                         Ah, Hermes! Crew, meet Hermes Conrad. 
                         He manages my delivery business, pays 
                         the bills, notifies next of kin, what 
                         have you.
 
               
                                     HERMES
                         Someone come and dropped this package 
                         through the slot last night. Now which 
                         one of you is the captain?
 
               
                                     FARNSWORTH
                         Oh, my! I haven't picked a new captain 
                         yet. It's always so hard to choose.
 
                         
               
               [He looks around the table. Fry is so enthusiastic he doesn't 
               manage to swallow his spoonful of cereal completely and milk 
               dribbles down his chin.]
 
               
               
               [Farnsworth looks at Bender who drinks back a bottle of beer 
               and belches a flame. He looks at Leela. She has already signed 
               Hermes' clipboard and she salutes to him.]
 
               
                                     FARNSWORTH
                         Hmm, you!

               
               [He points at her. Fry groans.]

               
               [Planet Express: Hermes' Office. Hermes sits at his desk facing 
               Leela. He slides a sheet of paper to her.]

                         OK, Captain, this is just a standard 
                         legal release protecting Planet Express 
                         from lawsuits in the event of the unforeseen.
 
                         
               
               [He hands Leela a piece of paper.]

                         previous captains but I intend to do 
                         as little dying as possible.
 
               
               [She puts the form on the desk and Hermes chuckles again. He 
               slides it back to her.]

                         Now Fry, before you go into space you'll 
                         need to see our staff doctor. I should 
                         warn you though, he's a little unusual. 
                         (whispering) He wears sandals!
 
               
               [Cut to: Planet Express: Zoidberg's Office. The doctor, a red 
               alien creature is sat in his chair with is feet on the desk. 
               Behind him is a chart of a human's internal organs - pinned to 
               the wall upside down.]

                         Dr. Zoidberg, this is Fry, the new delivery 
                         boy. He needs a physical.

               [He clacks his claws. Fry is not so sure.]

                         You'll be fine.

               
               [He turns to leave but looks back with a worried look on his

                         look at that brain.  No no no no no 
                         not that mouth!

                         as a crab. Can I go into space now?

                         As soon as we finish cleaning Bender. 
                         Oh, and Fry, this is our intern, Amy 
                         Wong. She's an engineering student of

                         I told you to turn around and go back 
                         to the park. But oh, no, the park was 
                         too phoney. We had to see the real moon.

                         a boring dried up wasteland. And the 
                         only reason anybody ever comes here 
                         is for the tacky little amusement park.

                                     BENDER
                         Of course not. A lady that fine you 
                         gotta romance first.
 
               
               [Another gunshot smashes the barn door behind Bender. Bender 
               legs it while the farmer reloads. Fry and Leela follow him through

               and land safely on the other side. They all cheer and then a 
               wheel falls off the buggy. The Crushintor approaches the other

                         Nightfall's coming.  Hurry, before we 
                         freeze.
 
               
               [The flee from the shadow.]

                         What do you mean "we", mammal?

               
               [Cut to: Planet Express: Farnsworth's Lab. He watches the crew 
               through a telescope.]
 
               
                                     FARNSWORTH
                         Oh, dear! I really ought to do something. 
                         But I am already in my pyjamas.
 
               
               [He falls asleep and starts snoring.]

               
               [Cut to: Lunar Surface. Fry and Leela are panting.]

               
                                     LEELA
                         We can't outrun it forever.

               
               [Fry sees something.]

               
                                     FRY
                         Over there! Look! It's the moon landing 
                         site! We found it!
 
               
               [They run towards it. Leela climbs the ladder and pushes over 
               the hatch.]
 
               
                                     LEELA
                         Quick, get in.

               
               [Fry sees the American flag.]

               
                                     FRY
                         It's that flag from MTV! And Neil Armstrong's 
                         footprint!  Hey! My foot's bigger! Leela, 
                         isn't this the greatest thing you've 
                         ever seen?
 
               
                                     LEELA
                         Fry, look around. It's just a crummy 
                         plastic flag and a dead man's tracks 
                         in the dust.  Now get in here before 
                         you freeze.
 
               
               [Fry sighs and climbs the ladder.]

               
               [Cut to: Apollo 11 Lander. Leela helps him in.]

               
               [Cut to: Lunar Surface. She closes the door just as Bender arrives.]
 
               
               
                                     BENDER
                         Oh, no room for Bender, huh? Fine! I'll 
                         go build my own lunar lander, with blackjack 
                         and hookers. In fact, forget the lunar 
                         lander and the blackjack. Ah, screw 
                         the whole thing.
 
               
               [He walks off.]

               
               [Apollo 11 Lander. Leela reads the oxygen gauge.]

               
                                     LEELA
                         Well if the oxygen holds out we might 
                         live long enough to starve to death.
 
                         
               
                                     FRY
                         Look, Leela, I'm sorry. I never should 
                         have dragged you out here.
 
               
                                     LEELA
                         That's right, you shouldn't have. I 
                         still don't get what the big attraction 
                         is.
 
               
               [Fry sighs.]

               
                                     FRY
                         I never told anybody this but a thousand 
                         years ago I used to look up at the moon 
                         and dream about being an astronaut. 
                         I just didn't have the grades. Nor the 
                         physical endurance. Plus I threw up 
                         a lot and nobody liked spending a week 
                         with me.
 
               
                                     LEELA
                         A week would be a little much.

               
                                     FRY
                         The moon was like this awesome, romantic, 
                         mysterious thing, hanging up there in 
                         the sky where you could never reach 
                         it, no matter how much you wanted to. 
                         But you're right. Once you're actually 
                         here it's just a big dull rock. I guess 
                         I just wanted you to see it through 
                         my eyes, the way I used to.
 
               
               [Leela looks through a window. She sees the Earth.]

                         Fry, look. It really is beautiful. I 
                         don't know why I never noticed before.
 
                         
               
               [Bender runs towards the capsule.]

               
               [Cut to: Lunar Surface. The farmer is chasing him in a weird 
               thing with spikes.]

                         Had to come back for the Crushinator, 
                         eh, robot? Well I got you this time.
 
                         
               
               [The spikes get closer to Bender. The Planet Express ship swoops 
               in above them. The magnetic winch lowers towards Bender.]

                         Amy? Where'd she learn to operate the 
                         controls like that?
 
               
               [Cut to: Ships Cockpit. Amy is operating the winch expertly, 
               having had practice at the Luna Park with the claw game. The 
               toys from the game are piled up in the corner.]

                         like the moon you used to dream about?
