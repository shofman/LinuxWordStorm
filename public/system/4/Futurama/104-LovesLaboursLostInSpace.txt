                         This place was a great choice. The food 
                         is amazing. And such generous portions.

                         You like the meal just wait until you 
                         try these after dinner mints.

                         You know, Doug, most guys are put off 
                         by my eye. It's nice to finally meet 
                         someone who's open-minded.  Ew!

                         put my finger on. Possibly his vile 
                         lizard tongue.

                         You're too picky.

                         Yeah. If you rule out every guy with 
                         a lizard tongue or a low I.Q. or an 
                         explosive violent temper, of course 
                         you're gonna be lonely.

                         medical. Soon she will drop her eggs 
                         and they will hatch and all will be 
                         well.

                         You just have to give guys a chance. 
                         Sometimes you meet a guy and think he's 
                         a pig. But then later you realise he 
                         actually has a really good body.

                         I just know these things. I've got what 
                         they call gaydar.

                         That's right. Animals in desperate need 
                         of rescue. You see, Vergon 6 was once 
                         filled with a super dense substance 
                         known as dark matter, each pound of 
                         which weighs over ten thousand pounds.

                         Well, dark matter is extremely valuable 
                         as starship fuel. That's why it was 
                         all mined out, leaving the planet completely 
                         hollow.

                         Now it seems that the planet will collapse 
                         within three days. Incidentally, this 
                         will kill all the animals.

                         I heard that one time you single-handedly 
                         defeated a horde of rampaging somethings 
                         in the something something system.

                         The Killbots? A trifle! It was simply 
                         a matter of outsmarting them.
 
               
                                     FRY

                         You see, Killbots have a preset kill 
                         limit. Knowing their weakness, I sent 
                         wave after wave of my own men at them, 
                         until they reached their limit and shutdown. 
                         Kif, show them the medal I won.

                         talk to you about our mission.

                         after wave of men at your disposal. 
                         Right men?

                         interfering with undeveloped worlds.
